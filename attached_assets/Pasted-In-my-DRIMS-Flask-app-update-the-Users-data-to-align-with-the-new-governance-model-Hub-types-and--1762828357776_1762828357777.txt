In my DRIMS Flask app, update the Users data to align with the new governance model, Hub types, and Agency Hub logic.


Normalize roles to use only these system roles:


System Administrator

Agency Hub User


Auditor / M&E Officer


(Optional for future) Inventory Clerk

Ensure:


The Role, Location, Hub Type, and Organization fields are consistent with the DRIMS governance rules:


Agency Hub User = independent Agency Hubs (e.g. Food for the Poor, Red Cross); their inventory is private and excluded from overall government stock summaries.


Main Hub User and Sub-Hub User are for government-owned hubs only.


Logistics Manager has final approval rights; Logistics Officer prepares but does not approve.


Auditor / M&E Officer is read-only.




Remove any legacy or deprecated roles such as Warehouse Staff, Field Personnel, Executive where used, replacing them with the aligned roles above.


Do not change passwords or authentication logic; only update the seed/user records and role mappings.




Apply these updates directly in the Users model/seed data so the DRIMS system reflects this exact configuration.

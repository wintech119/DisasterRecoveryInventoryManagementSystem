In my DRIMS Flask app, update all role-based dashboards (other than the Logistics Manager dashboard already defined) to use a modern, compact, consistent UI that follows:

Good dashboard design principles

WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines (color contrast, keyboard access, semantics)

Consistent layout, icons, and spacing across all roles

Apply these changes using our existing left-side navigation layout and base template.

Global Dashboard Design Standards (Apply to ALL dashboards)

Use a shared, modern layout:

Page heading with:

A consistent modern icon (e.g. simple outlined “dashboard/analytics” icon).

Role-specific title (e.g. “System Administrator Dashboard”, “Main Hub Dashboard”).

Light, clean background.

Clear visual hierarchy:

Top row: 3–5 compact KPI cards.

Below: tables or charts with real content.

UI/UX best practices:

Avoid clutter; use whitespace and tight but readable spacing.

No 3D charts, no garish colors.

Use consistent typography, icons, and card styles.

Make key sections scannable: labels, tooltips, and short headings.

Accessibility (WCAG 2.1):

Sufficient color contrast for text, icons, and status badges.

Focus states for interactive elements.

All icons accompanied by text labels or aria-labels.

Keyboard navigable (TAB through KPI cards, filters, tables, actions).

Data security:

Only show data each role is allowed to see based on DRIMS rules.

Agency Hubs remain independent: internal stock never shown in government dashboards.

Now implement dashboards per role as follows:

1. System Administrator Dashboard

Audience: System Administrator

Top KPI cards (compact):

Active Users

Active Hubs

Main vs Sub vs Agency Hub count

Pending user approvals (if applicable)

Sections:

Recent user changes / role assignments (table)

Recent hub creations/updates (table)

Notes:

No stock or fulfilment metrics.

Focus on configuration, users, and hubs.

All read/write actions link to existing Admin pages.

2. Logistics Officer Dashboard

Audience: Logistics Officer

Top KPI cards:

Needs Lists: Submitted (awaiting review)

Needs Lists: Fulfilment Prepared (awaiting LM approval)

Pending Fulfilment Change Requests

Transfers pending execution

Sections:

Table: Needs Lists queue (status, requesting hub, age, priority)

Table: Fulfilment drafts prepared by officer

Table: Change Requests requiring follow-up

Notes:

Emphasize workflow: “Review → Prepare Fulfilment → Send to LM”.

No final approval controls; all clearly marked as “Pending Logistics Manager”.

3. Main Hub User Dashboard

Audience: Main Hub User (for MAIN hubs only)

Top KPI cards (scoped to their Main Hub):

Current stock (units)

Open Needs Lists assigned to their Main Hub

Pending dispatches from this Main Hub

Recent transactions (last 7 days)

Sections:

Table: Needs Lists to fulfil (Sub-Hub / Agency) for their Main Hub

Table: Approved dispatches to execute

Optional mini-chart: Category distribution of their hub’s stock

Notes:

Show only their hub + linked workloads.

No global view; no internal Agency stock.

4. Sub-Hub User Dashboard

Audience: Sub-Hub User

Top KPI cards (scoped to their Sub-Hub):

Current stock

Needs Lists: Draft / Submitted

Incoming transfers pending

Distributions made (last 7 days)

Sections:

Table: Their Needs Lists + statuses

Table: Incoming transfers from Main Hub

Table: Recent intake and distributions

Notes:

No cross-hub visibility.

Clean, simple, focused on local operations.

5. Agency Hub User Dashboard

Audience: Agency Hub User (e.g. Red Cross, Food for the Poor, Shelters)

Top KPI cards (scoped to their Agency):

Needs Lists submitted

Approved vs Pending requests

Total allocations received from government

Last allocation date

Sections:

Table: Needs Lists (status, date, Main Hub)

Table: Transfers received (origin hub, date, items)

Optional: Download/print acknowledgement summary

Rules:

Do NOT show government internal stock.

Do NOT appear in global stock totals elsewhere.

6. Inventory Clerk Dashboard

Audience: Inventory Clerk (assigned to a single hub)

Top KPI cards:

Today’s intakes

Today’s distributions

Current stock lines (item count)

Pending data entries (if applicable)

Sections:

Table: Recent transactions at their hub

Quick actions panel:

“Record Intake”

“Record Distribution”

“Search Inventory”

Notes:

Highly operational, minimal analytics.

Strictly scoped to assigned hub.

7. Auditor / M&E Officer Dashboard

Audience: Auditor / M&E Officer

Top KPI cards:

Total Needs Lists (Approved / Fulfilled)

% Needs Lists fulfilled on time

Total items dispatched (Main + Sub Hubs)

Number of active hubs

Sections:

Table: Filterable fulfilment log (hub, status, dates)

Table: Exceptions/anomalies (e.g. partial fulfilments, change requests, delays)

Export buttons (CSV/XLSX) for reporting

Rules:

Read-only.

No internal Agency stock; show only transactions involving Agencies.

Technical Implementation Notes

Use a single /dashboard route:

Detect current_user.role (and hub if needed).

Render a role-specific partial or template that follows the shared layout.

Create reusable components:

KPI card component

Status pill component (Active/Inactive, etc.)

Standard heading with icon

Ensure all data queries enforce:

Role-based access

Hub-based scoping

Agency independence rules

Implement these changes so all role-based dashboards:

Look visually consistent and modern.

Are compact and easy to scan.

Follow WCAG-aligned accessibility and DRIMS security rules.

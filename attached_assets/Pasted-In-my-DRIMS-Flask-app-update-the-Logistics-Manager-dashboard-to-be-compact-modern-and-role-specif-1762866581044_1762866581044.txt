In my DRIMS Flask app, update the Logistics Manager dashboard to be compact, modern, and role-specific, following UI/UX best practices. This dashboard should give the Logistics Manager a clear national overview without clutter.

1. General Requirements

This dashboard is for users with role: Logistics Manager.

Use the existing left-side navigation layout.

Follow modern dashboard best practices:

Clean, minimal, compact.

Clear hierarchy: key metrics on top, drill-down below.

Consistent padding, spacing, and typography.

Mobile-responsive and readable on standard laptops.

Add a modern icon in the page heading:

Same style/icon set as other user dashboards (e.g. a simple outlined “grid/analytics” or “control panel” icon).

Keep icon consistent across all dashboards; just change heading text per role.

2. Top Summary Bar (Compact KPI Cards)

At the top of the Logistics Manager dashboard, add a row of small, compact KPI cards:

Total Main Hubs (Active)

Total Sub-Hubs (Active)

Total Agency Hubs (Active)

Total Items in Stock (Gov Hubs Only)

Open Needs Lists

Count of Needs Lists in key statuses: Submitted, Fulfilment Prepared, Awaiting Approval

Rules:

For Total Items in Stock, only include:

Hubs with type MAIN or SUB

Exclude Agency hubs from all stock totals.

Use concise labels, subtle icons, and no large blocks of text.

Each card should be clickable (optional) to filter or navigate to details later.

3. Hub Status & Stock Overview (Main + Sub-Hubs)

Below the KPI bar, add a compact table or grid showing per-hub information for all Main and Sub-Hubs:

Columns:

Hub Name

Hub Type (Main / Sub)

Status (Active / Inactive)

Current Stock Count (sum of quantities at that hub)

Last Activity (timestamp of last transaction: intake, distribution, or transfer)

Behavior:

Sort by Hub Type (Main Hubs first), then by Hub Name.

Use a small status pill:

Green = Active

Gray = Inactive

Make each row clickable to view that hub’s detailed inventory (existing page if available).

Do not show Agency internal stock here.

Keep row height tight but readable (compact, not bulky).

4. Category Distribution Chart (Gov Hubs Only)

On the right side or directly below the hub table (depending on screen width), show a visual summary of stock distribution by category.

Requirements:

Use only stock from:

MAIN and SUB hubs.

Exclude AGENCY hubs fully.

Group by category, e.g.:

Food & Water

Hygiene & Sanitization

Medical Supplies

Shelter & NFI

Logistics & Equipment

Use a simple, modern chart:

Horizontal bar chart or donut chart is fine.

Labels: Category + total units.

Keep it clean, no 3D, no cluttered legends.

5. Active vs Inactive Hubs Snapshot

Add a small, compact section (could be a mini chart or list) showing:

Count of Active vs Inactive:

Main Hubs

Sub-Hubs

Agency Hubs

Example layout:

“Main Hubs: 3 Active / 0 Inactive”

“Sub-Hubs: 5 Active / 1 Inactive”

“Agency Hubs: 4 Active / 2 Inactive”

Use small icons and aligned text—no giant widgets.

6. Permissions & Data Rules

This dashboard is visible only to:

Logistics Manager

(Optionally System Administrator for testing)

Must respect DRIMS rules:

Agency internal inventory is not shown.

Aggregated stats are based only on allowed data (Main/Sub for stock, Agency only as count/status and transactions).

All queries must be efficient and scoped:

Use proper filtering by hub_type and status.

7. Visual & UX Details

Use:

A single, modern icon in the page title (e.g. next to “Logistics Manager Dashboard”).

Consistent icon pack across all dashboards.

Keep everything:

Left-aligned.

With enough whitespace to avoid feeling congested.

No bright, harsh colors; use subtle accents for highlights and statuses.

Implement this as the default view for Logistics Manager when visiting /dashboard, using partials/components so other role dashboards can reuse the same layout and icon style.
